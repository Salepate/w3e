# Warcraft 3 - Project:Survive - Prologue Codebase
<hr/>

## Informations

This project uses Amalg to reduce iteration cost of working outside of War3 Editor.

I have created a simple plugin (see `amalg_plugin.lua`) to make code generated by Amalg compatible
with the lua vm included in War3.

Globals `require` and `package` cause a failure when loading a map in Warcraft 3. 
They are temporarily replaced with a working system.
`RestoreLua()` is invoked after the game has been initialized to restore the lua default environment.

## Required Programs

#### [Amalg](https://github.com/siffiejoe/lua-amalg) - created by siffiejoe

Will assemble all lua files based on require operations

## Generate code

### Windows 
Run Generate.bat with amalg installed within this folder `.git/amalg/amalg.lua`

Then, copy content of the generated `war3_code.lua` file within the editor

Make sure the amalg_plugin.lua is also in the editor and before the generated code.
